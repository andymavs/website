## What is UBNetDef?
University at Buffalo Network Defense (UBNetDef) is UB's Cyber Security class & club. Every semester, we hold several classes to grow students of all skill levels. In addition, we have a subset of students compete in competitions - our [Competition Team](/about/competition-team).

## What classes do you offer?
Please see the [courses](/courses) page. Typically we offer an introductory course, one-two intermediate/advance level courses, and a leadership course (owning UBNetDef Operations).

## Who can come?
UBNetDef's beginner course, [Systems Security](/courses/syssec), is open to any interested student. No prior experience is required! For other courses, it will be up the course instructor.

## How do I contact UBNetDef?

In addition, we utilize a self-hosted chat solution on the following website: [chat.ubnetdef.org](https://chat.ubnetdef.org) - if you would like an invite, please send us an email.
