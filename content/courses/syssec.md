Students will critically examine concepts such as basic networking, system administration, and system security as well as identifying and applying basic security hardening techniques.  Students will gain practical experience through a virtualized lab environment where they will be building a small corporate network.

## Course Materials
- National Cyber League (http://www.nationalcyberleague.org) registration.

## Course Requirements
### Lectures
Attendance for all lectures is **mandatory** and each absence will result in a **full letter grade penalty**.  One absence or late arrival is permitted without penalty.  Students arriving late or unprepared may also receive a penalty at the discretion of the instructor.  Absences due to illness may be excused if the instructor is notified in advance, and the illness is documented by a physician or healthcare professional.

### Homework Assignments
<div class="alert alert-info">
	This list of homework assignments is subject to change.  For an up-to-date list, please visit the course website.
</div>

#### Build-A-Network Project
As a note, the “Extra Mile” deliverables were created for advanced students who already know the material.  Completion of Extra Mile deliverables is for “bragging rights” only.  No additional or bonus points will be awarded if a group completes them.  We will, however, stress that groups should do them, and possibly create a leaderboard for them as well.

#### Report Policies

### Competition Participation
<div class="alert alert-info">
	The Crucible, a competition that happens during the semester in Systems Security, **does not count** for this requirement.
</div>

All students are required to participate fully in a Cyber Security competition, as well as the UB Lockdown competition.  Various competitions will be announced throughout the academic semester.

## Getting Assistance
The best way to request assistance is to ask on the `#syssec` channel on UBNetDef’s slack.  The instructors and mentors are constantly on the slack, so it’s likely you will get a response within 24-hours, if not less.  If you do not have access to the UBNetDef slack, please contact an instructor.

## Grading Policy
Grading is done on a point scale, with a max available points of 2600.  Late submissions are accepted, however, there will be a deduction of 50 points per week the deliverable due is late.

Points are accumulated by the following ways:

1. Assignments - 1800 Points
  1. Build-A-Network: 600 Points
  2. Wiki Guides: 600 Points
  3. Reports: 600 Points
2. Competition Participation - 800 Points
  1. Competitions will be announced during the semester.  Examples include: National Cyber League, UB Lockdown, RIT ISTS, Alfred State ASIST.
  2. Each competition attended is worth 400 points.

The grading scale is as follows:

<table class="table">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>A</td>
			<td>2000-2600 Points</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>B</td>
			<td>1400-1900 Points</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>C</td>
			<td>800-1300 Points</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>D</td>
			<td>400-700 Points</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>F</td>
			<td>0-300 Points</td>
		</tr>

## Course Conduct
### Academic Integrity
Students must conduct their coursework in a manner that does not violate the University at Buffalo’s Academic Integrity Policy.  Students found in violation of the [Academic Integrity Policy](http://undergrad-catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/course/integrity.html) will receive an F for the course.

### Ethics Policy
As a student in cyber security, you are learning tools and given resources that are meant to help protect yourself and others. However, these tools and resources can also be used in malicious or illegal ways. It is imperative that while you are a representative of this class, and even well after, you perform any security education or training strictly inside our internal environment or a controlled and contained environment that you have prepared for yourself. Any activity outside of our internal environment is outside of our control and protection. If you are not sure what you’re doing, it is very easy to do something illegal without even knowing you are (even something as simple as port scanning outside our internal network). If you are unsure if something is allowed or not, contact one of the instructors or mentors. **All network traffic inside our infrastructure will be monitored for malicious or suspicious activity and acted upon with severe consequences if such privileges are abused.** You are being given an opportunity to learn, please do not waste it.

### vCenter Usage
As a part of Systems Security, you are granted permissions to create Virtual Machines on the vCenter environment, for educational purposes.  Any misuse of the environment will result in the **immediate failure of the student.**

### Network Logging Disclaimer
All traffic that occurs within the vCenter environment is being **logged** for analysis purposes.  Traffic captures (pcaps) may be shared with other individuals within UBNetDef for educational purposes only. **We highly discourage logging into any personal or social networking websites on a Virtual Machine hosted in the vCenter environment.**
