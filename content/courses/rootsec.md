# Overview
This course introduces students to the tools and methodologies used in a penetration test.  Lessons will be delivered via an online resource (https://r00tsec.org), reinforced through labs, and eventually assessed through a week long penetration test against an unknown network.  This course will meet three times a week (MWF) for an hour, at a time mutually convenient for all students.

Students wishing to take this course should have basic knowledge of networking, as well as exposure to a Linux operating system.

Upon completion of this course, students should be prepared for the [Penetration Testing with Kali (PWK)](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/penetration-testing-training-kali-linux/) course and exam (not required).

# Course Conduct
## Academic Integrity
Students must conduct their coursework in a manner that does not violate the University at Buffalo’s Academic Integrity Policy.  Students found in violation of the [Academic Integrity Policy](http://undergrad-catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/course/integrity.html) will receive an F for the course.

## Ethics Policy
As a student in cyber security, you are learning tools and given resources that are meant to help protect yourself and others. However, these tools and resources can also be used in malicious or illegal ways. It is imperative that while you are a representative of this class, and even well after, you perform any security education or training strictly inside our internal environment or a controlled and contained environment that you have prepared for yourself. Any activity outside of our internal environment is outside of our control and protection. If you are not sure what you’re doing, it is very easy to do something illegal without even knowing you are (even something as simple as port scanning outside our internal network). If you are unsure if something is allowed or not, contact one of the instructors or mentors. **All network traffic inside our infrastructure will be monitored for malicious or suspicious activity and acted upon with severe consequences if such privileges are abused.** You are being given an opportunity to learn, please do not waste it.
