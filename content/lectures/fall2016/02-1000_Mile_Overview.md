# The Overview
What is cyber security (or information assurance, information security)?

## Pillars of Cyber Security
CIA Triangle (Availability how easy access to data, making sure services up and running, Confidentiality permission levels and Integrity making sure the data is correct encryption and hashes)

### OSI Model
* 1 Physical
* 2 Data-Link
* 3 Network
* 4 Transport
* 5 Session
* 6 Presentation
* 7 Application

## The Hats
* White Hat- Someone who testing network venerability for positive outcome. Help patch and protect and they have good intention. Law and permission and hack ethics. Have scope professional 
* Gray Hat – Bounty Hunters. Thin line, 30 days to patch this or we release it to the world
* Black Hat-  no permission for personal gain. No ethical hacking.

### Cyber Threat Landscape
* Target Breach
* Use Various Tools (Phishing, Social Engineering, Hardware, New Threats) 

### Cyber Competitions - Red/Blue/Purple?
* Blue Team: Trying to defend the network
* Red Team: Make different shapes and sizes (penetration testing

# Virtualization
## Different Operating Systems
* Windows
* Mac OS X
* Linux
* iOS
* Android

## System Resources
* Memory (RAM)
* Storage (HDD/SSD)
* Processor (CPU)
* etc...

## Whats a Virtual Machine (VM)?
* Computers within computers
* All running on same set of resources
* Can do different things at the same time
* Can run multiple VM’s on one set of hardware
* VM’s typically run on virtual hard drive
    * Can easily transfer
    * Can easily snapshot

## Benefits of Virtualization
* Security: Separate applications from interfering with each other
* Testing: Open unknown, potentially malicious files
* Learning: Try out new programs without having to worry
* Resource optimization: Use what you have more efficiently 
* Many more!

## Hypervisors
Fancy word for software that runs at the OS level to manage VM’s

## Clustering
* One server to rule them all
* Ability to manage multiple hypervisors at once
* Combine resources 
* Redundancy
