# Virtualization
## Different Operating Systems
* Windows
* Mac OS X
* Linux
* iOS
* Android

## System Resources
* Memory (RAM)
* Storage (HDD/SSD)
* Processor (CPU)
* etc...

## Whats a Virtual Machine (VM)?
* Computers within computers
* All running on same set of resources
* Can do different things at the same time
* Can run multiple VM’s on one set of hardware
* VM’s typically run on virtual hard drive
    * Can easily transfer
    * Can easily snapshot

## Benefits of Virtualization
* Security: Separate applications from interfering with each other
* Testing: Open unknown, potentially malicious files
* Learning: Try out new programs without having to worry
* Resource optimization: Use what you have more efficiently 
* Many more!

## Hypervisors
Fancy word for software that runs at the OS level to manage VM’s

## Clustering
* One server to rule them all
* Ability to manage multiple hypervisors at once
* Combine resources 
* Redundancy
